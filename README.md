AIM: Designing a cost-effective arm housing 5 servos controlled by one slave ESP32 taking commands from a remote ESP32 by establishing WIFI communication between the two, essentially one acting as server and the other one as client. The user will have to relay finger flex data to the arm and control the servos using client ESP accordingly.
